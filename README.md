- 👋 Hi, I’m @Arnie-66
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D Printing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything that I can about 3d printing. I own an Ender 3 Pro and I'm mostly using PLA and PLA+
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3d printing and using cad, as I would love to learn to design my own creations for 3d printing
- 📫 How to reach me: arnold_williams66@yahoo.com
